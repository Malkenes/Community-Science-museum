                <p>Velociraptors were only about the size of a turkey, but they were still fierce predators.</p>
                <p>Some dinosaurs, like the Brachiosaurus, were so large that they could eat up to 880 pounds of food in a single day.</p>
                <p>The T-Rex had teeth the size of bananas, and its jaws were strong enough to crush bones.</p>
                <p>Scientists believe that some dinosaurs had feathers, which means they might have looked more like birds than reptiles.</p>

                <p>Homo erectus, who appeared about 2 million years ago, was the first species to leave Africa and spread throughout the world.</p>
                <p>Homo neanderthalensis, who lived in Europe and Asia from about 400,000 to 40,000 years ago, was closely related to modern humans and had a larger brain than earlier human species.</p>
                <p>Homo sapiens, the species to which modern humans belong, evolved in Africa about 300,000 years ago and spread to other continents around 60,000 years ago.</p>
                <p>The modern human brain is larger and more complex than those of earlier human species, and modern humans have developed sophisticated tools, languages, and cultures.</p>

                <p>Brain Evolution: Some scientists speculate that human brains may continue to evolve and become more complex, leading to enhanced cognitive abilities.</p>
                <p>Physical Adaptations: Others suggest that humans may continue to adapt physically to changing environments, such as developing better heat tolerance or resistance to diseases.</p>
                <p>Cyborgs and Bioengineering: There is a growing interest in bioengineering and cyborg technology that could lead to the creation of enhanced humans with robotic or artificial components.</p>
                <p>Genetic Engineering: The ability to manipulate the human genome could lead to selective breeding or genetic enhancement, although this raises ethical concerns.</p>
                <p>Extraterrestrial Evolution: If humans colonize other planets, they may adapt to different environments and evolve into new species.</p>

                <h1>EVOLUTION</h1>
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                -You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn't survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.
