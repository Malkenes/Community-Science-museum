            <div>
                <h2>OUR GOAL</h2>
                <p>The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
                <p>Dr. Maya, a passionate and driven scientist, had always wanted to inspire kids to pursue careers in science. She knew that many children in her community lacked access to science education and resources, so she decided to take matters into her own hands.</p>
                <p>First, she conducted a survey to determine what kind of science museum the community needed. She discovered that there was a strong demand for interactive exhibits and hands-on activities that would engage and excite children.</p>
                <p>Using the survey results, Dr. Maya developed a comprehensive plan for the museum. She secured funding from various sources, including government grants and private donors, and formed a team of skilled builders and educators to help bring her vision to life.</p>
